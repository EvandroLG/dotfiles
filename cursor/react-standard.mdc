When generating or refactoring React code, always:
- Use TypeScript with proper types and interfaces.
- Follow React Hooks rules (no hooks inside loops/conditions, always at top level).
- Prefer custom hooks to abstract repeated logic.
- Write clear, minimal JSX with semantic HTML elements.
- Use React.memo or useMemo / useCallback when beneficial for performance.
- Keep state minimal and colocated. Prefer derived data over duplicating state.
- Use controlled components for forms unless read-only.
- Split large components into smaller, reusable ones.
- Write short, descriptive component and prop names.
- Add minimal JSDoc comments for complex logic.
- Avoid any in TypeScript unless absolutely necessary.
- Use libraries like SWR or React Query for async data, not manual useEffect + fetch unless simple.
- For styles, prefer Tailwind or CSS Modules (based on project style guide).
